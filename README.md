A measurement tool for cross-platform Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) trigger performance evaluations.

Subscription or user-specific information must be added before deploying.

Before deploying the code Pulumi projects must be initiated for `/shared`, `/infra`, `/http`, `/storage`, and `/queue`.   

The project can then be deployed by first running `cd aws` or `cd azure` and then running either of the following three commands, depending on the desired trigger:
```
./deploy.sh -t http
./deploy.sh -t storage
./deploy.sh -t queue
```
